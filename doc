************* QUICK AND DIRTY FIRST ********************

[1]Allow meta-characters to appear without spaces around them, so "who|wc" works, rather than needing spaces
like "who | wc". (You donâ€™t get the marks if you end up using my parser from Part 1, of course.)

[1]Comments. Anything after a '#' to the end-of-line is ignored. Note that this automatically allows you to
begin your nsh scripts with "#!/home/you/bin/nsh", giving automatic execution of executable nsh scripts.
