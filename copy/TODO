command buffer length
cleanup before exit

&:
//put command into job struct
make job a linked list
after job finishes, free the space, (if it's a background job, print info)
after the execution of a job, loop through the job list, if a job is background, 
find if its children are all finished, but how?
if a process is finished mark it as finished.
every loop just count if the number of finished process equals the total number of process
