How to Test:
make
nsh test_script > f1
sh  test_script > f2
diff f1 f2


Extension and Bugs:
[1 mark] Implement background execution using '&'.
  Bug: This may or may not constitute as a bug: my background job does not show message when a background job is created or reaped.
[1 mark] Comments. Anything after a '#' to the end-of-line is ignored. Note that this automatically allows you to
begin your nsh scripts with "#!/home/you/bin/nsh", giving automatic execution of executable nsh scripts.
  Bug: This may or may not constitute as a bug: standard shell treats abcd#efg exactly as abcd#efg, my shell treats it as abcd.
       Since the requirement above states, "Anything after a '#' to the end-of-line is ignored, I choose to follow this instruction       instead of how a standard shell behaves.
[1 mark] Allow meta-characters to appear without spaces around them, so "who|wc" works, rather than needing spaces
like "who | wc". (You don’t get the marks if you end up using my parser from Part 1, of course.)
[1 mark] Implement the shell escape character using "\", so "echo \|" will output a single "|".
[1 mark] Implement the “exit” command. With no arguments, it exits with the exit status of the most recently
executed command, or it accepts a single integer argument which will be nsh’s exit status.
[2 marks] Implement single quoting so arguments can have spaces inside them.
[3 marks] Handle more than one pipe. Eg., “who | grep foobar | uniq –c | sort –nr | less”
